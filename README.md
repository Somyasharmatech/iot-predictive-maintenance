# IoT Predictive Maintenance Dashboard

This project is a complete, end-to-end solution for a predictive maintenance system. It demonstrates how to build a modern data engineering pipeline, integrate a machine learning model, and visualize real-time data in a live dashboard.

## üöÄ Live Demo

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **End-to-End Data Pipeline:** A robust system that moves simulated sensor data through a streaming platform and into a live database.

* **Real-time Predictions:** A machine learning model that predicts equipment failure in real-time.

* **Interactive Dashboard:** A multi-page, visually appealing dashboard built with React that provides live data graphs and manual prediction capabilities.

* **Scalable Architecture:** The project is designed with a modular architecture, making it easy to scale or adapt to different use cases.

* **Full Deployment:** The entire project is deployed on free cloud services, making it publicly accessible and professional.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
* **Frontend:** React, Recharts (for charts), Tailwind CSS

* **Backend:** Python, FastAPI

* **Database:** TimescaleDB (on Railway)

* **Streaming:** Apache Kafka (local simulation)

* **Deployment:** Git, Render, Docker

## üìà Project Architecture
* The project follows a modern, real-time data architecture.

* A Python simulator generates sensor data (temperature, vibration, pressure).

* The data is sent to a local Apache Kafka broker.

* A Python consumer reads the data from Kafka and inserts it into a live TimescaleDB database hosted on Render.

* A Python FastAPI API, also hosted on Render, loads a pre-trained machine learning model.

* The React frontend dashboard fetches data from the live database and makes real-time predictions from the API.

## üí° Future Improvements
* This project can be further enhanced by:

* Implementing continuous retraining of the AI model to improve its accuracy over time.

* Adding a more sophisticated anomaly detection model to automatically detect abnormal behavior.

* Building a user authentication system to protect the dashboard from unauthorized access.

* Creating a multi-device monitoring system to track the health of multiple machines simultaneously.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation and Setup
This project can be run locally using Docker and Python.

Clone the repository:
